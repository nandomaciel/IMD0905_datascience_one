        "At many points in your career, you'll need to be able to build complete, end-to-end data science projects on your own. **Data science projects usually consist of one of two things:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- An exploration and analysis of a set of data. One example might involve analyzing donors to political campaigns, creating a plot, and then sharing an analysis of the plot with others.\n",

        "We'll focus **primarily on data exploration** in this section. We'll also combine several messy data sets into a single clean one to make analysis easier. Over the next few missions, we'll work through the rest of our project and perform the actual analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The first step in creating a project is to decide on a topic**. You want the topic to be something you're interested in and motivated to explore. It's very obvious when people are making projects just to make them, rather than out of a genuine interest in the topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are two ways to go about finding a good topic:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Think about what sectors or angles you're really interested in, then find data sets relating to those sectors.\n",
